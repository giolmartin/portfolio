## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further refine my skills in state management and explore more complex React patterns. Additionally, I'm interested in integrating animations and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This was invaluable for understanding some features of React.
- [Styled Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs) - An excellent resource for learning about CSS-in-JS and what makes it so strong in the development process.
